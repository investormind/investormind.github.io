    If we have a look at the topic of saving, we will notice that there are mainly two groups of views out there:<br />
    &#10137; <u>According to the first view, saving is worthless</u>. After all, you end up sacrifycing living a quality life for so little.<br />
    &#10137; <u>The other view is the complete opposite</u>. It stands that every penny is worth saving. It does not matter how much time and effort you will need to dedicate to save that penny, because at some point it will accumulate to a much bigger sum.<br />
    
    <strong>Which</span> view is better?</strong><br />
    As with everything, a mix of both is what you should aim at.
    This is what we refer to as <span class="highlight">"Smart saving"</span>.
    
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        We estimate that an average person could save around <strong>&pound;1,000,000.00</strong> over the course of his life.

<h3>Smart savings</h3>
So, what is "samrt savings" about? It is about taking the best from both: die-hard savers and non-savers, who prefer to live and enjoy a high standard life.
The good news is that by following certain rules, you can optimise the process to start saving significant amounts of money without having to drastically reduce your standard of life or - in some cases - even without affecting it at all.
The key concept is to understand the quality to price 

<h3>Quality to Price, the golder rule</h3>

<h3>The 3 rules of smart savings</h3>
<h4>1.Do your research</h4>
Knowledge is power. Most people don't save not because they don't like it, but because they don't know.
This is so you don't fall into high-standard people category. Don't overpay for products and services. You need knowledge. There are hundersa of business that just live form the fact that people don't know.'
